        Hey there. Yes, you. We see you. The real you full of potential, dreams,
        and strength. You're not alone in this journey, and every choice you
        make shapes your story. Today, you have the power to write a chapter
        free from the chains of addiction.

      <h1>What You Should Know</h1>
      <p>
        When you use drugs, they hijack your brain's reward system—the same
        system that responds to things that make you feel good naturally. They
        flood your brain with dopamine, creating an artificial high that your
        brain starts to crave. But here's the thing: <em>you</em> are stronger
        than any chemical. Your mind and body have incredible resilience, and
        understanding how these substances work is your first step toward
        freedom.

      <p>
        If you're reading this, part of you is already considering a different
        path. That takes courage, "REAL COURAGE". Whether it's for yourself or
        someone you care about, reaching out isn't a sign of weakness. It's the
        strongest move you can make. Your journey is confidential, and your
        privacy matters to us as much as it does to you.

      <p>
        The temporary escape comes at a cost that touches every part of your
        life. Your relationships, your health, your future, they all feel the
        impact. But here's what matters: where you are right now doesn't
        determine where you can go. Every day without substances is a victory,
        and those victories add up to a life reclaimed.

        Right now, in this moment, you can take a step that your future self
        will thank you for. A conversation is just that—a conversation. No
